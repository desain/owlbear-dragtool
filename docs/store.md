# Drag tool

Track character movement across multiple drags. Works like a more mobile-friendly version of various 'measure along path' plugins.

**How to use**

Select your the Drag tool, then click and drag on a character or mount token to start a drag sequence. Each new drag adds to the sequence, which keeps track of its total length.

Click the scaling icon in the tool modes menu to change how much each grid unit is scaled. 1x is normal, 2x means all distances are double, 0x means all distances are ignored.

Use the 'ruler' or 'ruler private' modes to measure distances without moving tokens.

**Support**

If you need support for this extension, create a Github issue.
